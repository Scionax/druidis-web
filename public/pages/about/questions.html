					<p>Druidis cares about the issue of disinformation. We are highly discouraged by other social media platforms that have chosen to insufficiently address this problem.</p>

					<p>We realize that some of these measures prevent actions that could otherwise be useful, but we're deciding to balance this tradeoff as best we can moving forward.</p>
