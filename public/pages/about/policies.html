			<p>One of the most important aspects of disinformation is to keep people occupied with useless, usually negative news. Bad actors can exploit social media to create trending news that doesn't matter.</p>
			<p>As a result, negative news prospers, and real journalism gets suffocated. Therefore, anything posted in the "news" forum must pass the "Is this useful to society?" test.</p>
			<p>If the answer is no, it doesn't belong on Druidis. Our news forum is reserved for quality journalism.</p>

		<div class="full text">
			<p>Bad-faith actors push divisionary articles that keep people angry at each other, rather than focusing on real issues. If everyone hates each other, there's no focus on corrupt practices.</p>
			<p>On popular forums you'll see memes about how vegans are annoying, or articles on how journalism is corrupt, but you won't find articles discussing big oil or political donors.</p>
			<p>Divisionary tactics are often insidious and hard to spot. Ask yourself if the article is making two groups oppose each other. If so, don't post it.</p>

			<p>To find the sources you DO want to post, consider what good journalism actually looks like. Due to the effects of bad-faith actors, it's often hard to find.</p>
			<p>News outlets survive on views, which these days is directly tied to social media, which is turn tends to trend based on the actions bad-faith actors. As such, bad-faith actors get to influence the news.</p>
			<p>To combat this issue, Druidis will work to post journalism that actually matters, and give those who deserve it a chance to shine.</p>

				<h2>Be mindful of subtle attacks against marginalized communities.</h2>
				<div class="note1"></div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="full text">
			<p>The bad actors of the world often use underhanded attacks against minorities in an effort to divide and distract. Infuriatingly, many news sources comply, holding minority groups to bizarrely different standards than the rest of society.</p>
			<p>For example, news often points out that a specific minority did a crime, even though it bears no statistical or meaningful relevance to the crime itself. These inclusions are often subtle to maintain deniability, so you must be proactive in catching them.</p>
			<p>Content on Druidis regarding any unfairly marginalized communities (e.g. LGBT, immigrants, etc), must always be appropriately respectful and supportive.</p>

				<div class="note1"></div>

		</div>
		<div class="full text">
			<p>Generally, this already fails the "is this useful to society" test, but it's so common in news that it merits a separate policy.</p>
			<p>While there may be certain exceptions, generally this news is just click-bait "he said she said" petty drama that doesn't actually serve the public. It's either trying to get clicks or is PR directed some group that may or may not align with your interests.</p>
			<p>If there is substance in what the person was saying, there will usually be articles that more accurately reflect that substance elsewhere.</p>

				<h2>Certain accomodations must be made for captivating attention.</h2>
				<div class="note1"></div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="full text">
			<p>Avoiding disinformation is one thing, but removing anything that captivates human attention would result in a boring site that nobody uses. We still need headlines that captivate the audience, and we're still going to have cat videos. Facts are great, but humans need to have fun.</p>
			<p>Veritasium created an <a href="https://youtu.be/S2xHZPH5Sng">excellent video</a> on how articles peak curiosity and draw attention, while simultaneously distinguishing it from clickbait. It's worth the watch.</p>
			<p>So after considering all the previous angles, make sure you're invested in the idea that the site should also act as a source of entertainment. It's okay to have trending news that doesn't seem particularly beneficial to society, as long as it's not *detrimental* to society. Just make sure to use it in moderation.</p>
