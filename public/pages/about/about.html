			<p>Removing CO2 isn't the only benefit that you get from using our services. Your activity translates into trees getting planted.</p>
			<p>Planting trees has several amazing benefits. It creates habitats for animals, expands and improves ecosystems, saves water, prevents pollution, prevents erosion, conserves energy, improves mental health, cleans the air, provides oxygen, and much more.</p>
			<p>There are areas of the world that benefit even more from trees being planted, and that's where Druidis is focused on tree planting through the organizations we plant trees with.</p>

				<h2>Druidis was inspired by Ecosia. A search engine that plants trees.</h2>

			<p>Druidis was inspired by <a href="https://www.ecosia.org/">Ecosia's ingenious idea</a>. Before us, they were converting the profits from their search engine into planting trees and investing in renewables. We ran with the idea, but for social media.</p>

				<h2>Druidis is taking REAL action to prevent the spread of disinformation.</h2>
				<div class="note1">We also intend to work with experts that can ensure we're doing it correctly.</div>

		<div class="full text">
			<p>Disinformation is a serious problem. Powerful special interests have been spreading disinformation for decades, and social media has become a primary target.</p>
			<p>Unlike certain other social media platforms, Druidis won't ban experts that are investigating the impacts of disinformation. We *want* to work with people who are addressing the issue.</p>
			<p>Druidis is highly curated from the top down, and anonymous accounts can't influence the primary content. This makes it MUCH harder for bad actors to spread lies.</p>
			<p>We also intend to maintain features that will protect our users and equip us with the tools to track and penalize bad actors.</p>
