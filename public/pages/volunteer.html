					<p>We take community moderating a bit more seriously than other social media sites, but it's something that anyone can do to support our cause.</p>

					<p>Sometimes, the best thing you can do for a project is to bring attention to it. We need people to talk about us, even if that's just telling your friends and family, posting about it on social media, or involving a community you're already a part of.</p>
					<p>If you already have a large established audience (influencers, journalists, writers, etc), please let us know and we'll try to find ways to work with your community.</p>
