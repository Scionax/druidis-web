						<p>How? Simple. For every minute you spend on Druidis, Druidis commits to removing 1 pound of CO2 from the atmosphere. You're being environmentally responsible by browsing the web!</p>
						<p>Using this 1-minute metric, Druidis has a benchmark for how many trees we need to plant or which types of renewable resources we need to invest in.</p>

						<p>Removing CO2 isn't the only benefit that you get from using our services. Your activity translates into trees getting planted.</p>
						<p>Planting trees has several amazing benefits. It creates habitats for animals, expands and improves ecosystems, saves water, prevents pollution, prevents erosion, conserves energy, improves mental health, cleans the air, provides oxygen, and much more.</p>
						<p>There are areas of the world that benefit even more from trees being planted, and that's where Druidis is focused on tree planting through the organizations we plant trees with.</p>
						<p>Even though environmentalists often focus on greenhouse gases, it's important to remember that trees do a lot of good for other reasons!</p>

							<div class="h3">Druidis is taking REAL action to prevent the spread of disinformation.</div>
							<div class="short">We also intend to work with experts that can ensure we're doing it correctly.</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="full">
						<p>Disinformation is a serious problem. Rich special interests have been spreading disinformation for decades, and social media has become a primary target.</p>
						<p>Unlike certain other social media platforms, Druidis won't ban experts that are investigating the impacts of disinformation. We *want* to work with people who are addressing the issue.</p>
						<p>Druidis is highly curated from the top down, and anonymous accounts can't influence the primary content. This makes it MUCH harder for bad actors to spread lies.</p>
						<p>We also intend to maintain features that will protect our users and equip us with the tools to track and penalize bad actors.</p>

						<p>If you're a content creator you should consider sponsoring us, collaborating with us, or featuring us to your audience. Spreading awareness of our project can help us a lot.</p>

							<div class="short">A: To protect against disinformation, we restrict public posting in critical sections.</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="full">
						<p>Druidis cares about the issue of disinformation. We are highly discouraged by other social media platforms that have chosen to insufficiently address this problem.</p>
						<p>The issue can be solved in many ways, but to start, Druidis holds user accounts to very high accountability to post in critical areas. This prevents nearly all of the typical abuse seen on other sites.</p>
						<p>We realize that some of these measures prevent actions that could otherwise be useful, but we're deciding to balance this tradeoff as best we can moving forward.</p>
