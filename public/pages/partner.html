					<p>If you create content, there are lots of ways to collaborate with Druidis. We can exchange promotion and sponsorships to share our audiences with each other, exchange partner links, exchange content creation (e.g. articles, videos, etc), and more!</p>
					<p>We love to feature quality content anyway, and we'll actively try to uplift and promote anyone that supports our mission. So let's find a way to work together!</p>

					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="full">
					<p>&bull; We will only work with companies that are genuine, ethical, reputable, and beneficial for consumers.</p>
					<p>&bull; We may have to vet your company (or the related product or service) before considering an arrangement.</p>
					<p>&bull; We reserve the right to end our relationship if we discover that a brand has behaved unethically.</p>
					<p>&bull; Sponsors can trust us to produce "brand-safe" content if we work with you.</p>
					<p>&bull; You can review sponsored content prior to us publishing it.</p>
					<p>&bull; We will collaborate within reason on how your brand messaging is relayed to the public, but you may not influence our core messaging about your product or service (unless we agree with it).</p>
					<p>&bull; You may be expected to provide us with your product or service for our vetting process.</p>
					<p>&bull; We can probably coordinate specific schedules for sponsorship releases within reason, but check with us first to confirm this since we may not always be able to guarantee it.</p>
